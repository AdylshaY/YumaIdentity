A centralized Identity and Access Management (IAM) service for your applications. Powered by .NET, structured with Clean Architecture, backed by MS SQL Server, and designed for easy Docker-based deployment.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Centralized Authentication:** Manage users and access for all your applications from a single place.
- **Clean Architecture:** A highly modular and maintainable codebase that separates concerns.
- **.NET Powered:** Built on the robust and performant .NET platform.
- **Database Support:** Uses Microsoft SQL Server for reliable data storage.
- **Dockerized:** Comes with a `Dockerfile` for easy containerization and deployment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** .NET / C#
- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server
- **Containerization:** Docker

## 🏛️ Architecture

This project is built using the principles of **Clean Architecture**. This design pattern ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the application:
- Independent of frameworks.
- Testable.
- Independent of UI.
- Independent of the database.

The main layers of the application are:
- **Domain:** Contains enterprise-wide logic and types.
- **Application:** Contains application-specific logic.
- **Infrastructure:** Handles external concerns like database access, file systems, and external APIs.
- **Presentation:** The entry point to the application (e.g., a Web API).

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/AdylshaY/YumaIdentity.git
    cd YumaIdentity
    ```

2.  **Configure Database:**
    -   Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` with your MS SQL Server details.
    -   Run database migrations to set up the schema.
    ```sh
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

### Initial Admin User Setup

The application is designed to create a default admin user upon its first launch. The source of the admin credentials depends on the environment you are running the application in.

#### Running with Visual Studio / .NET CLI

When you run the project directly from an IDE like Visual Studio or via the `dotnet run` command, the initial admin user's credentials are read from the `appsettings.json` file. Make sure you have a section like this:

```json
"AdminSeed": {
  "AdminClientId": "admin-dashboard-client",
  "AdminClientName": "YumaIdentity Admin Dashboard",
  "AdminClientSecret": "SUPER_SECRET_ADMIN_CLIENT_PASSWORD_123!",
  "SuperAdminEmail": "superadmin@yuma.com",
  "SuperAdminPassword": "Admin1234!"
}
```

#### Running with Docker Compose

When you run the project using `docker-compose`, the credentials for the initial admin user are sourced from a `.env` file located in the root directory of the project. Create a `.env` file with the following content:

```env
AdminSeed__AdminClientId=admin-dashboard-client
AdminSeed__AdminClientName=YumaIdentity Admin Dashboard
AdminSeed__AdminClientSecret=YumaIdentityAdminClientSecret
AdminSeed__SuperAdminEmail=superadmin@example.com
AdminSeed__SuperAdminPassword=SuperAdminPassword
```
The `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to pass these environment variables to the service.

> **⚠️ Security Warning:**
> It is strongly recommended to change the default admin password immediately after your first login, especially before deploying to a production environment.

### Running the Application

**Using .NET CLI:**
```sh
dotnet run
```

**Using Docker:**
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```
